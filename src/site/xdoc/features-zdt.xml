    <title>JSF Extensions Zero Deployment Time</title>
  </properties>

  <body>

    <section name="Warning">

     <p>The presence of the <code>jsf-extensions-dev-time.jar</code> in
     your <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory opens up a big security
     hole in your application, in the name of ease of development.  Do
     not deploy your application into production with this jar in your
     <code>WEB-INF/lib</code>.
     </p>

    </section>

    <section name="Usage">

     <p>One oft cited complaint about Java Web Applications is the slow
     and laborious <a
     href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=35538">deployment
     step</a>.  This step seriously undermines the ability to get into a
     <a href="http://web.ionsys.com/~remedy/FLOW%20%20.htm">flow
     state</a> and is generally a major buzz kill.  The absense of a
     deployment step is one reason why people like Ruby on Rails so
     much.</p>

     <p>JSF-Extensions Design time brings good news for flow-impaired
     Java Web application Developers: the JMX PhaseListener.</p>

       <subsection name="HowTo">

         <p>Here's how to use this feature in to iteratively develop a
         JSF 1.2 application deployed via a "deploydir"-style deployment
         on a JMX enabled Java EE container, such as <a
         href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/">the Java EE
         SDK</a>.</p>

	<ol>

	  <li><p>Download the <a
	  href="http://jsf-extensions.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">jsf-extensions
	  binary bundle</a> from the "releases" folder.  </p></li>

	  <li><p>Unpack the binary, take the
	  <code>jsf-extensions-dev-time-&lt;VERSION&gt;.jar</code> </p>
	  and drop it into your JSF application's
	  <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory.</li>

	  <li><p>Deploy the app to your container using the "deploydir"
	  feature.  In <a
	  href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/">Java EE 5 SDK</a>
	  or <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">glassfish</a>
	  this can be done using the command</p>

          <blockquote>
           ./asadmin deploydir --user admin --passwordfile &lt;PATH_TO&gt;/.javaee-passwordfile --contextroot &lt;CONTEXT_ROOT&gt; &lt;ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_EXPLODED_WAR_DIRECTORY&gt;
          </blockquote>

          <p>For example, this command deploys the cardemo:</p>

          <blockquote>
           ./asadmin deploydir --user admin --passwordfile /Users/edburns/.javaee-passwordfile --contextroot jsf-ajax-cardemo /Users/edburns/Projects/J2EE/workareas/jsf-extensions-trunk/code/run-time/samples/cardemo/target/jsf-ajax-cardemo
          </blockquote>


           </li>


	  <li><p>Look at your <code>WEB-IND/web.xml</code> and note the
	  <code>url-mapping</code> for the <code>FacesServlet</code> in
	  your application.  You already have to have such a mapping if
	  you're using JSF in the first place.</p>

          <p>For prefixed mapped applications, any HTTP request to the
          following URL will cause your application to be immediately
          stopped and restarted via JMX.</p>


          <blockquote>
            <code>http://&lt;HOST&gt;[:&lt;PORT&gt;]/&lt;CONTEXT_ROOT&gt;/&lt;FACES_SERVLET_MAPPING&gt;/restart?password=adminadmin</code>
          </blockquote>

          <p>On extension mapped applications, the following URL is your
          man.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <code>http://&lt;HOST&gt;[:&lt;PORT&gt;]/&lt;CONTEXT_ROOT&gt;/restart.&lt;FACES_SERVLET_MAPPING&gt;?password=adminadmin</code>
          </blockquote>

          <p>With the obvious substitutions, of course, and the password
          being "adminadmin" by default.  You can change the restart
          password with a <code>&lt;context-param&gt;</code>.</p>

          <p>For example, with the Cardemo, this command uses wget to
          restart the application via JMX.</p>

          <blockquote>
wget --spider http://localhost:8080/jsf-ajax-cardemo/faces/restart?password=adminadmin
          </blockquote>


          </li>

	</ol>

       <p>Upon receipt of a request with this URL, the
       <code>PhaseListener</code> will use JMX to stop and restart the
       application.  This takes a fraction of the time that a full
       redeploy takes, yet all of the java classes in your app, as well
       as all of the config files, are re-loaded. </p>

<dl>
<dt>Note, due to a bug in glassfish, the web.xml is not re-loaded when
this JMX method is used.  A fix for this bug is in progress.
</dt>
</dl>

       </subsection>

       <subsection name="Reference">

         <p>The <code>JMXPhaseListener</code> in
         <code>jsf-extensions-dev-time</code> supports the following
         options, specified as <code>&lt;context-param&gt;</code>
         elements in the web.xml.  All of these parameters are optional
         and have sensible defaults.</p>

<dl>

<dt>com.sun.faces.RESTART_PASSWORD
</dt>

<dd><p>The password that must be given as the value of the
<code>password</code> URL query parameter in the restart URL.  If not
specified the value of "adminadmin" (without the quotes) is assumed.</p>
</dd>

<dt>com.sun.faces.ADMIN_PASSWORD
</dt>

<dd><p>The JMX password.  In most cases, this is equal to the admin
password.  If not specified, the value of "adminadmin" (without the
quotes) is used.</p>
</dd>

<dt>com.sun.faces.ADMIN_PORT
</dt>

<dd><p>The port on which the JMX server is listening.  If not sprcified,
the value of 4848 is used.</p>
</dd>
