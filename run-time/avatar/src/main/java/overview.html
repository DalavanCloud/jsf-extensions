<p>JSF Extensions brings first class support for AJAX to JSF.  This is
achieved by declaring an override for the
<code>javax.faces.ViewRoot</code> <code>component-type</code>.  The
implementation for this class extends <code>UIViewRoot</code> and allows
for lifecycle processing over one or more subtrees of the view,
depending on client requirements.  Custom JSF <code>Lifecycle</code> and
<code>StateManager</code> implementations are provided to support the
<code>UIViewRoot</code> subclass in its processing.  These decorate
their respectieve default implementations and add a small amount of
functionality to support AJAX.  </p>

<p>The principal classes for supporting AJAX include:</p>

<dl>

<dt><p>{@link com.sun.faces.extensions.avatar.components.PartialTraversalViewRoot}</p>
</dt>

<dd><p>Extend <code>UIViewRoot</code> and allow for partial view processing.</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>{@link com.sun.faces.extensions.avatar.lifecycle.PartialTraversalLifecycle}</p>
</dt>

<dd><p>Decorate the default lifecycle and take special case action when
an AJAX request is detected.  Otherwise, the default lifecycle is
used.</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>{@link com.sun.faces.extensions.avatar.lifecycle.AsyncResponse}</p>
</dt>

<dd><p>ThreadLocal accessible class for interacting with the AJAX
response as it is being created.</p>
</dd>

<dt>{@link com.sun.faces.extensions.avatar.application.DeferredStateManager}
</dt>

<dd><p>Decorate the default <code>StateManager</code> to take no action
during an AJAX request.  This is necessary because the state saving is
initiated in the <code>PartialTraversalLifecycle</code>.</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>{@link com.sun.faces.extensions.avatar.event.EventCallback}</p>
</dt>

<dd><p><code>javax.faces.components.ContextCallback</code> implementation
that allows the client to send events to the JSF view.</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>{@link com.sun.faces.extensions.avatar.components.ScriptsComponent}</p>
</dt>

<dd><p>Renders necessary script elements in the browser.  Exposed via
custom tag.</p>
</dd>
